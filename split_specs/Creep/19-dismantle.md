{% api_method dismantle 'target' A %}

```javascript
const target = creep.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_STRUCTURES,
	{filter: {structureType: STRUCTURE_WALL}});
if(target) {
    if(creep.dismantle(target) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
        creep.moveTo(target);
    }
}

```

Dismantles any structure that can be constructed (even hostile) returning 50% of the energy spent on its repair. Requires the WORK body part. If the creep has an empty CARRY body part, the energy is put into it; otherwise it is dropped on the ground. The target has to be at adjacent square to the creep.

{% api_method_params %}
