## About Game.cpu

A global object containing information about your CPU usage.

## Members

{% api_method Game.cpu.getHeapStatistics '' 1 %}

```javascript
let heap = Game.cpu.getHeapStatistics();
console.log(`Used ${heap.total_heap_size} / ${heap.heap_size_limit}`);
```

Use this method to get heap statistics for your virtual machine. The return value is almost identical to the Node.js function [`v8.getHeapStatistics()`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/v8.html#v8_v8_getheapstatistics). This function returns one additional property: `externally_allocated_size` which is the total amount of currently allocated memory which is not included in the v8 heap but counts against this isolate's memory limit. `ArrayBuffer` instances over a certain size are externally allocated and will be counted here.

### Return value

Returns an objects with heap statistics in the following format:

```javascript-content
{
  "total_heap_size": 29085696,
  "total_heap_size_executable": 3670016,
  "total_physical_size": 26447928,
  "total_available_size": 319649520,
  "used_heap_size": 17493824,
  "heap_size_limit": 343932928,
  "malloced_memory": 8192,
  "peak_malloced_memory": 1060096,
  "does_zap_garbage": 0,
  "externally_allocated_size": 38430000
}
```

{% api_method Game.cpu.getUsed '' 1 %}

```javascript
if(Game.cpu.getUsed() > Game.cpu.tickLimit / 2) {
    console.log("Used half of CPU already!");
}
```

```javascript
for(const name in Game.creeps) {
    const startCpu = Game.cpu.getUsed();

    // creep logic goes here

    const elapsed = Game.cpu.getUsed() - startCpu;
    console.log('Creep '+name+' has used '+elapsed+' CPU time');
}

```

Get amount of CPU time used from the beginning of the current game tick. Always returns 0 in the Simulation mode.

### Return value

Returns currently used CPU time as a float number.

{% api_method Game.cpu.halt '' 1 %}

```javascript
Game.cpu.halt();
```

Reset your runtime environment and wipe all data in heap memory.
