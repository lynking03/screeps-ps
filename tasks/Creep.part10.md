# Creep: part 10 of 14
Module: `Screeps.Internal.Creep.Part10`
Files: `src/Screeps/Internal/Creep/Part10.purs` and `src/Screeps/Internal/Creep/Part10.js`
Bind ONLY these members: notifyWhenAttacked, pickup, pull
Other parts bind the rest of Creep. Do not bind anything not listed above.

## About Creep

Creeps are your units. Creeps can move, harvest energy, construct structures, attack another creeps, and perform other actions. Each creep consists of up to 50 body parts with the following possible types:

Inherits from RoomObject: those members are bound elsewhere.

## Members

{% api_method notifyWhenAttacked 'enabled' A %}

```javascript
if(creep.memory.role == 'scout') {
	creep.notifyWhenAttacked(false);
}
else {
	creep.notifyWhenAttacked(true);
}
```

Toggle auto notification when the creep is under attack. The notification will be sent to your account email. Turned on by default.

{% api_method_params %}
enabled : boolean
Whether to enable notification or disable.
{% endapi_method_params %}

### Return value

One of the following codes:
{% api_return_codes %}
OK | The operation has been scheduled successfully.
ERR_NOT_OWNER | You are not the owner of this creep.
ERR_BUSY | The creep is still being spawned.
ERR_INVALID_ARGS | enable argument is not a boolean value.
{% endapi_return_codes %}

{% api_method pickup 'target' A %}

```javascript
const target = creep.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_DROPPED_RESOURCES);
if(target) {
    if(creep.pickup(target) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
        creep.moveTo(target);
    }
}

```

Pick up an item (a dropped piece of energy). Requires the CARRY body part. The target has to be at adjacent square to the creep or at the same square.

{% api_method_params %}
target : Resource
The target object to be picked up.
{% endapi_method_params %}

### Return value

One of the following codes:
{% api_return_codes %}
OK | The operation has been scheduled successfully.
ERR_NOT_OWNER | You are not the owner of this creep.
ERR_BUSY | The creep is still being spawned.
ERR_INVALID_TARGET | The target is not a valid object to pick up.
ERR_FULL | The creep cannot receive any more resource.
ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE | The target is too far away.
{% endapi_return_codes %}

{% api_method pull 'target' 0 %}

```javascript
creep1.move(TOP);
creep1.pull(creep2);
creep2.move(creep1);
```

```javascript
const target = creep.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_MY_CREEPS, {
    filter: function(object) {
        return (object.getActiveBodyparts(MOVE) == 0) && 
            object.memory.destinationId &&
            !object.pos.isNearTo(Game.getObjectById(object.memory.destinationId));
    }
});
if(target) {
    if(creep.pull(target) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
        creep.moveTo(target);
    } else {
        target.move(creep);
        if(creep.pos.isNearTo(Game.getObjectById(target.memory.destinationId))) {
            creep.move(creep.pos.getDirectionTo(target));
        } else {
            creep.moveTo(Game.getObjectById(target.memory.destinationId));
        }
    }
}
```

Help another creep to follow this creep. The fatigue generated for the target's move will be added to the creep instead of the target. Requires the MOVE body part. The target has to be at adjacent square to the creep. The creep must move elsewhere, and the target must move towards the creep.

{% api_method_params %}
target : Creep
The target creep.
{% endapi_method_params %}

### Return value

One of the following codes:
{% api_return_codes %}
OK | The operation has been scheduled successfully.
ERR_NOT_OWNER | You are not the owner of this creep.
ERR_BUSY | The creep is still being spawned.
ERR_INVALID_TARGET | The target provided is invalid.
ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE | The target is too far away.
{% endapi_return_codes %}
